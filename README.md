# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
My motivation for this project was to help home in my newfound coding skills that I have been learning with-in the last few weeks, and to show newcomers like myself that it is possible. I build this project to help future coding students by giving them an outline on the different coding languages and GitHub software. I hope if you are new to the world of coding that this site may benefit you while you build and learn to build you very first website project. I have learned lots over the past few weeks, I haven't had much of a background in any of the coding languages but working on this project has really helped me discover that if you put in the practice, your result can be whatever you want.
